# Redux OMDB APP

This is a small movie index that I made as a homework during my time at the [HENRY](https://www.soyhenry.com/) Fullstack bootcamp (which I'm still in the process of completing it!)

Even though the initial homework was made with some help from other students or teachers, I personally added some functionalities and QoL improvements, such as converting most class component to functional ones, and fixed bugs regarding bad user input (eg seaching movies by sending null data as input) or incomplete database information (some movies from OMDB lack posters), among other stuff listed below.

To run the app, use the commands ```npm install``` and ```npm start``` to install dependencies and run it on a local server, respectively.

The project is not finished yet though, so feedback of any kind is always appreciated!
